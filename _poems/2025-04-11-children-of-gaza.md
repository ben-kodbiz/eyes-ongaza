*A poem dedicated to the children of Gaza who have suffered immensely*

## Children of Gaza

Little hands once held pomegranates,
now cradle stones —
their only toys left
in streets tattooed with ash.

The lullabies stopped —
but Heaven hums for them now.
Gardens unbroken. Rivers unpoisoned.
They run where no drone can follow,
under the shade of Sidratul Muntaha.

O children of Gaza —
your names are written in gold
while the generals of Zion
sign death warrants in dust.

We — the scattered Ummah —
we raise your names
like minarets on our tongues.
We curse the cowards in marble palaces
who sip tea over your graves.

By Allah, the Day will come
when they will beg the earth to swallow them.
But Hell yawns wide,
and it forgets no tyrant.

*In memory of the innocent children of Gaza*
