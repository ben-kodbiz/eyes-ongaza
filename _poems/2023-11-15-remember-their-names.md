*A poem dedicated to the innocent children who have lost their lives in Gaza*

## Remember Their Names

Remember their names,
Though they number in thousands,
Each one a light extinguished too soon,
Each one a story unfinished.

Remember their faces,
Though the world turns away,
Their smiles frozen in photographs,
Their dreams buried beneath rubble.

Remember their laughter,
That once filled narrow streets,
Now silent as the bombs fall,
On schools, on homes, on hospitals.

Remember their innocence,
For they knew not of politics,
Of borders, of occupation,
Only of kites and footballs.

Remember their mothers,
Who rock empty cradles,
Who scream names into the dust,
Who search through the ruins.

Remember their fathers,
Who carried small bodies,
Wrapped in white shrouds,
Too light, too small, too many.

Remember Gaza's children,
Not as statistics,
Not as collateral damage,
But as Mahmoud, as Fatima, as Yusuf.

Remember them when you speak of peace,
Remember them when you speak of justice,
Remember them when you speak of humanity,
Remember them, remember them, remember them.

For what is history if not memory?
And what is memory if not resistance?
And what is resistance if not love?
Love for those whose names we remember.

*In memory of all the children who have lost their lives in Gaza*
